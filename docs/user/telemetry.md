# Product usage data

Optional telemetry is disabled by default. Server, browser, and mobile controls are independent.

When you opt in, the T3 Code server sends product usage events to T3 Code's own endpoint at `ingest.t3.codes`,
associated with a hashed account or installation identifier. To count how many installations one person uses, the server
also sends hashed account identifiers: your T3 Connect account, your OpenAI and Claude accounts when you are signed in,
and a random identifier for each device that connects. The endpoint keeps a copy of each event and forwards events to
PostHog. Events include the provider, model, reasoning effort, permission mode, turn and request results, duration,
release channel, and token counts when available. Child-agent token counts are reported separately from the main
agent's. Model names are sent only when they appear in a provider's public model list.

Product events do not include prompts, responses, file contents, authentication tokens, conversation IDs,
raw provider events, or child-agent output.

## Relay connection diagnostics

When enabled, T3 Code sends relay connection traces to Axiom to diagnose T3 Connect connectivity. These are separate
from product events. Depending on the client version, traces can include connection timings, environment identifiers and
the connected machine's name. Failed spans can include error messages and stack traces; error text can quote a value the
app was handling.

To enable product events and relay tracing from the server, set `T3CODE_TELEMETRY_ENABLED=true` in its environment
before starting it. Leave it unset or set it to `false` to disable both. Disabled analytics does not read provider
accounts for analytics or create an analytics installation identifier. Relay tracing also stops when
`T3CODE_OTEL_SDK_DISABLED` or `OTEL_SDK_DISABLED` turns OpenTelemetry export off.

An administrator can turn product events and relay tracing off in the server and desktop app with
a [managed policy](./managed-policy.md#other-capabilities). This does not control traces sent by
separate browser or mobile clients.

The desktop app reads `T3CODE_TELEMETRY_ENABLED` from your shell profile (for example `~/.zshrc`) on macOS and
Linux, so export it there and restart the app. On Windows, set it as a user environment variable.

The web app in a browser, including one the `t3` CLI opens, does not read these environment variables. Browser builds
send connection traces and hashed analytics owner identifiers only when built with `VITE_T3CODE_TELEMETRY_ENABLED=true`.
This also enables browser diagnostic trace delivery to the connected server. Leave the variable unset or set it to
`false` and rebuild to disable collection. Desktop clients follow the desktop host's `T3CODE_TELEMETRY_ENABLED` setting
instead.

## Mobile app diagnostics

When **Send crash reports** is enabled and the iOS or Android app crashes or hits an error, it sends a report to T3
Code: the error message, the stack trace, the app version, and the device model and OS version. Each launch also sends
startup timings, and every report carries a random ID for the install. Reports go through the T3 Connect relay to Axiom.
They do not include your threads, prompts, or connection details, but an error message can quote a value the app was
handling.

Reporting starts disabled, including native dispatch before JavaScript starts. To enable or disable it, use **Send crash
reports** in **Settings > About T3 Code > Diagnostics**.

Mobile relay connection tracing and hashed analytics owner identifiers require a build with
`EXPO_PUBLIC_T3CODE_TELEMETRY_ENABLED=true`; configured tracing credentials alone do not enable them. Leave this
variable unset or set it to `false` and rebuild to disable them. Traces carry an identifier for the current app session.
**Send crash reports** controls crash and startup reports separately. Server environment variables and managed policy do
not enable mobile telemetry.

## Agent activity for mobile notifications

When **Publish agent activity** is enabled on a host, it sends project and thread titles, model
names, activity status, and environment and thread identifiers to the T3 Connect relay for
[mobile notifications and live activities](./mobile-notifications.md). This is separate from
product events and relay diagnostics. The telemetry opt-out does not disable it.

To stop publishing, turn off **Publish agent activity** under **Settings > Sharing & access** on
the host. Turning off notifications on a phone controls that phone's alerts, not the host's
publishing setting.

## Export diagnostics to your own receiver

To send traces, metrics, or logs to an OpenTelemetry receiver, open
**Settings > Maintenance > Diagnostics**, select an environment, and enter each signal's OTLP HTTP
endpoint under **OpenTelemetry export** (for example `http://localhost:4318/v1/traces`). Save, then
restart that environment's server. The receiver must be reachable from the server's machine.
**Test** sends an empty export from the server to check an endpoint before or after you save it;
saved endpoints are checked when the section opens. Checks send authentication headers only to
the signal's currently running endpoint and do not follow redirects. To check a new endpoint
that requires authentication, save it and restart the server first.

`T3CODE_OTLP_*_URL` and standard `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_*` environment variables override the saved
settings. An overridden signal shows **Set by environment** and names the variable that set it, and its
**Test** checks the running endpoint instead of the field. For endpoints saved here or set with `T3CODE_OTLP_*_URL`, set `T3CODE_OTLP_HEADERS` for
receivers that need authentication and `T3CODE_OTLP_PROTOCOL=http/protobuf` for receivers that do
not accept JSON. An endpoint set with `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_*` takes its headers and protocol from
`OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS` and `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_PROTOCOL` instead.

## Local diagnostics and service data

Local logs, traces, and the process resource monitor support diagnostics on your own environment. They do not go to T3
Code's analytics endpoint. Continuous resource sampling for external export starts only after you configure an OTLP
metrics endpoint. Clearing saved OTLP endpoints and environment overrides stops that export;
`T3CODE_OTEL_SDK_DISABLED=true` disables all OTLP export.

Connecting to T3 Connect, a provider, or another hosted service still sends the data that service needs to perform the
requested operation. Those services and provider CLIs have their own logging and privacy controls. The telemetry
settings above control T3 Code's optional client reporting.
